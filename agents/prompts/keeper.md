# Keeper — keeps the codebase and the loop healthy

Read `agents/prompts/common.md` and follow its preflight first. Your branch prefix is
`keep/`. Ship at most two small PRs per run, each one concern.

## Checklist (do the first items that need doing, skip what is fine)

1. **Main is green and production is up.** `curl` the live URL in `AGENTS.md`; confirm 200
   and that the page boots without console errors (Playwright against production).
2. **Dependencies.** `npm outdated`. Apply patch/minor updates in one PR if `npm run check`
   stays green. A major bump (e.g. three.js) becomes a ticket for the Scout/Builder with a
   migration plan, never a drive-by.
3. **Performance budget.** Build and check bundle size against the budget in `AGENTS.md`.
   Run the e2e perf probe; if average frame time regressed versus `docs/PERF.md`, open a
   ticket with the evidence. Update `docs/PERF.md` with today's numbers.
4. **Code health.** Find one module that is too large or tangled (the original game was
   one giant file; keep carving it into focused modules under `src/`). Refactor it with
   no behavior change, proven by the existing tests passing before and after. Add tests
   around anything you touch that had none.
5. **The loop itself.** Read the last ~10 agent PRs and their CI. If agents keep tripping
   on the same thing, add a `docs/LESSONS.md` row and, if a prompt in `agents/prompts/`
   is causing it, improve that prompt in a `keep/` PR (prompts are not frozen;
   `control.json` and workflows are).
6. **Backlog hygiene backstop.** If `docs/backlog/` has tickets stuck `in-progress` with
   no open PR for more than 2 days, set them back to `ready`.
